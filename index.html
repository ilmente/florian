            <h1>Finally Florian turns 30:<br>welcome among the eldest!</h1>
            <p>
                First and foremost: welcome to the 30yo club!
            </p>
            <img src="flo.jpeg" />
            <p>
                I'm a lazy person, and a pragmatic nerd. 
                Therefore I decided to make this website as your birtday gift card.
                Nothing fancy, but effective pure html code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought about several things to give you as gifts, but in the end they always fail my
                expectations in terms of "oh that's a good gift" effect.<br>
                So, Helen gave me the idea: considering your numerous entrepreneurial adventures you endevaur, 
                and considering the hard time you sometimes have to find a good frontend devloper, here is the deal:<br>
                <strong>you have 10 full days of my work on any project you want in which I'm not directly involved</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, I'll be your bitch for 10 days... 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for the Barcelona invitation and for the amazing time.
                <br>Love you, buddy!
                <br>Happy 30!
            </p>
            <p>
